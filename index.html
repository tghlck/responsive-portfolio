        My name is Adam Toomey, I was born and raised in New Hampshire. I grew up in Northern New Hampshire, went to
        school at Plymouth State University where I studied Graphic Design and Printmaking. I now live in the seacoast
        area, where I work as a production coordinator at a promotional marketing company.

        I love playing music and going to shows. I play guitar and am a total gear-head, because pedals are fun of
        course. Going to see live shows are one of my favorite things to do, I started playing in a metal band in
        highschool and ever since I've been in love with seeing bands preform live. Some of my favorite bands I've seen
        live were,
        Fury, Title Fight, Stevie Nicks, Dinosaur Jr., Cloakroom, Ekulu, and Illusion.

        I've always liked playing video games, I used to play competivive FPS games and stream on Twitch but I've since
        stopped and now I just play World of Warcraft primarily.

        Reading is awesome, one of my favorite authors is Stephen King, his Dark Tower series is my favorite set of
        books I've ever picked up, I also love anime and my 35th anniversary Akira hardcover bookset I hold near and
        dear to my heart.

        Art is a passion of mine, my fine art medium of choice is printmaking. I like the subtractive method of carving
        blocks, I found woodcuts while I was in an introductory course at PSU and fell in love. I started using linoluem
        as it was easier to achieve better line quality and finer details but then quickly paired it with my graphic
        design background to bring my prints to the computer screen and being able to rework them as I please.
        I've gotten to do some really cool freelance projects, some of the work I've done is the album art work for the
        Massachusetts based band Vanna's album "All Hell" and the re-branding for Oregan based band Trove.</p>
